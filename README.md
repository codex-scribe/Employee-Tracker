# Employee-Tracker

## Description
This command-line application provides an easy and interactive way to track employees at an organization, organizing them into tables based on departments, role titles, and the staff members themselves.  The databases are interactively stored in MySQL and generated entirely based on user input.  The user can also update an employee's role at any time.

## Instructions
To use the application, download the repository, and then run "npm i" in a terminal.  After installing the node packages, run the application by entering "node server.js" in the root level of the folder.  

You will be prompted with a series of options, to view or add departments, roles, and employees.  It is best to have all your information ready at hand before starting the process.  At any point, complete tables of the information are available for viewing by selecting the relevant options in the terminal.

## Required software
Any terminal/command line application is adequate to use this program.  You must also install node.js on your computer to download the other dependencies and run the program in the terminal.
